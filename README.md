[Play the game (Only for devices with keyboard)](https://the-jungle-view.fweiss.com/)

Based on phaser: https://mozdevs.github.io/html5-games-workshop/en/guides/platformer/initialise-phaser/

This game has been created in a little less than 8 hours.

The goal was to create a prototype of a "serious game" trying to make visual tests more fun.

The code is dirty and will not be touched as it was sort of a "hackaton"
